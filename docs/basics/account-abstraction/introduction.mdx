## Introduction

The introduction of Account Abstraction as a standard in the Ethereum Ecosystem is a welcome development that ensures the ability to onboard the next billion users to Web3. This standard has also been extended into Fuse blockchain. Fuse is EVM compatible and this typically means that features available on Ethereum are available on the Fuse blockchain.

The difference is that the Fuse ecosystem provides a higher Transactions Output Per Second (TPS) and thus a faster Block Time for validating transactions. With the introduction of Account Abstraction into Fuse, DApp developers can now build without having to worry about onboarding traditional web2 users, who might have to come to use their applications and find a steep learning curve as is commonly associated with onboarding using wallets that are non-custodial and require users to recall their private keys and/or mnemonic seed phrases, given whichever scenario. So, to make it easier for developers to onboard users, Fuse has built the [Fuse Connect](fuse-connect) Wallet.

The FuseBox powers Account Abstraction by default, enabling creating, managing, and engaging with Fuse Smart Wallets in client applications. Fuse Smart Wallets are Smart Contract Wallets which can be created with a user's Externally Owned Account (EOA), or Social Authentication methods, and provide added security compared to traditional EOAs. Fuse Smart Wallets are non-custodial and users can deposit and withdraw funds that no one else can control, at any time.

The FuseBox is designed to make it easy for developers to create, manage, and engage with Fuse Smart Wallets in their REST API, Flutter and TypeScript applications. FuseBox which is powered by the Open Source [Fuse Backend](https://github.com/fuseio/fusebox-backend/blob/master/README.md) provides pre-built functions and utilities, allowing developers to build Account Abstraction powered applications securely and efficiently.

### **Benefits of using Fuse Smart Wallets**

Using Fuse Smart Wallets provides several benefits, including:

- Enhanced security: Fuse Smart Wallets are non-custodial accounts that allow users to deposit funds that no one else can control and withdraw at any time. Each Fuse Smart Wallet is a smart contract associated with the user's EOA and can only be controlled by that user.
- Enhanced UX: Fuse Smart Wallets support gasless transactions, improving the user experience and making it more seamless to interact with the blockchain.
- Better developer experience: The Fuse Wallet SDK abstracts away the complexities of web3 development, such as cryptography, wallet management, and smart contract interactions, making it easier for developers to build blockchain-based applications.
