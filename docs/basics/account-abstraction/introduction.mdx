## Introduction

The adoption of Account Abstraction as a standard in EVM-based chains marks a significant advancement, facilitating the onboarding of the next billion users to Web3. This innovation has been integrated into the Fuse blockchain as well, which, being EVM compatible, ensures that features available on Ethereum are also accessible on Fuse.

A key distinction of the Fuse ecosystem is its higher Transactions Per Second (TPS) capability, leading to faster block times for transaction validation. With Account Abstraction, DApp developers on Fuse can now focus on their creations without worrying about the traditional challenges of onboarding Web2 users. These challenges often include a steep learning curve associated with managing non-custodial wallets, remembering private keys, or mnemonic seed phrases.

Powered by the FuseBox, Account Abstraction is enabled by default, facilitating the creation, management, and interaction with Smart Contract Wallets within client applications. These Smart Contract Wallets can be initiated using a user's Externally Owned Account (EOA) or via Social Authentication methods, offering enhanced security over traditional EOAs. Importantly, Smart Contract Wallets are non-custodial, allowing users complete control over their funds at any time.

The FuseBox, built on the Open Source Fuse Backend, simplifies the development process for creating and managing Smart Contract Wallets across REST API, Flutter, and TypeScript applications. It provides developers with pre-built functions and utilities to securely and efficiently develop applications powered by Account Abstraction.

### **Benefits of Using Account Abstraction on Fuse**

Account Abstraction on Fuse offers numerous advantages, such as::

- Enhanced security: Smart Contract Wallets, as non-custodial accounts, grant users exclusive control over their funds, with the wallet's smart contract only operable by the associated user.
- Improved User Experience: Supporting gasless transactions, Smart Contract Wallets facilitate a smoother interaction with blockchain applications, eliminating common barriers to entry.
- Better developer experience: The Fuse SDKs abstracts the complexities of web3 development, including cryptography, wallet management, and smart contract interactions, allowing developers to more easily create blockchain-based applications.
