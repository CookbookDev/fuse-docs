# Social Logins on Fuse Blockchain

Social logins have emerged as a method for user authentication in web3 applications due to their convenience and ease of use. By leveraging their existing social media accounts, users can effortlessly authenticate themselves without the hassle of remembering additional login credentials. This simplifies the login process and expedites registration by eliminating the need to fill out a lengthy registration form. User can choose to authenticate into web3 applications using only their Email Account. This is good for the following reasons:

### 1. Easy Onboarding:

Account abstraction involves separating the control of an account (ownership and permission) from the execution of transactions. Easy onboarding simplifies the process for users to create and manage accounts without requiring extensive technical knowledge.

- Users can easily create accounts without needing to manage private keys directly.
- Onboarding processes involve user-friendly interfaces or applications that abstract the complexities of cryptographic key management.

### 2. Social Recovery:

Social recovery is a mechanism that allows users to regain access to their accounts with the help of trusted social contacts in case of `key loss` or account compromise. It enhances security by providing a decentralized way to recover access.

- Account abstraction systems can implement social recovery by allowing users to designate friends or contacts as recovery agents.
- In case of `key loss`, a consensus among these trusted contacts can be used to recover or reset the account.

### 3. Ease of Use:

Ease of use in the context of account abstraction means providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users interacting with blockchain accounts. Abstracting away complexities like cryptographic key management contributes to a more user-friendly environment.

- User interfaces can be designed to be intuitive, hiding technical details related to private key handling.
- Integrating account abstraction mechanisms into wallets or applications can enhance user experience by simplifying tasks like account creation, transaction signing, and recovery processes.

In the series of guides, we will walk you through examples where you can authenticate into your applications deployed on the Fuse Blockchain by leveraging Account Abstraction.
