### Create a Smart Contract Wallet

The `init` method is a fundamental feature of the FuseBox JS SDK that enables you to setup a wallet by parsing the `PRIVATE_KEY` from an EOA. In the example below, we parse the `PRIVATE_KEY` and `API_KEY` to the `init` method. Get `API_KEY` [here](https://console.fuse.io/build). We use the `EthersJS` library to access the `PRIVATE_KEY` of the EOA. After a Smart Contract Wallet has been initialized, we can read it using the `getSender()` method.

Note: Developers can use the EthersJS `createRandom()` to create new random Wallets.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { FuseSDK } from "@fuseio/fusebox-web-sdk";

const main = async () => {
  const apiKey = "API_KEY";
  const credentials = new ethers.Wallet("PRIVATE_KEY");

  const fuse = await FuseSDK.init(apiKey, credentials);

  console.log(`Sender Address is ${fuseSDK.wallet.getSender()}`);
};

main();
```
